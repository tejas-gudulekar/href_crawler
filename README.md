# href_crawler
href_crawler is a python script that crawls through the targetted website and looks for all the "href" attribute/tag within the target URL scope and stores its value in a .txt file. This script can be useful for the penetration tester as the output of the scripts gives us all the possible links in the targetted URL which can be tested for bugs. The scripts also give the options to get login in the targetted website to increase the scope while looking for the links that belong to the targetted website.

# USAGE:

git clone 

cd href_crawler

python installer.py

python href_crawler.py
